                <h2>The Gamer's Struggle</h2>
                <p class="txt">
                    Being a gamer and a student can prove challenging in this time and age, especially when new and exciting games are constantly being released. Black Ops 4, Red Dead Redemtion 2, Spider-Man and so many other games act as side-quests that prevent us from doing what we are supposed to do: Study. Sometimes it is good to get out of your home enviroment and away from your games. However sometimes the library is too quiet and the study halls too cold and serious, and that is when coffee places comes into play!
