                    Starbucks is a very popular place for studying. This Starbucks is small and very cozy. It has 2 areas where you can sit down, inside and outside.  Since it is quite a small place, it is best to work with individual assignments or read, since it is pretty quiet there. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you need to use your computer, it is best to  sit inside where there is a place for your computer to be charged. There are a lot of other people working on their assignments as well, which will only motivate you. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The outside area is best for reading books or writing notes. The tables are bigger in the outside area. When it is raining, you can hear the drops hitting against the glass roof. The whole outside area is covered glass, so you are able to watch other people go about their day.

                <h2>Espresso House</h2>

                <address>
                    <p>
                        Address:  Strømgaten 8, 5015 Bergen
                    </p>
                </address>

                <p> This Espresso House is located in Bergen Storsenter and is a really great place for studying alone. It is very small. There are a row of desks facing a window that allows you to watch everyone walking outside if you wish. Here you can sit and read/work alone in peace because your back will be facing the rest of the coffee place. This creates the illusion of being alone and you will not get distracted by the people around you. On the desk there is plenty of space for your books, notebooks and laptop.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you absolutely want to work with your group here, we recommend sitting either in the sofas to the left of the enterance or around the big, square tables next to the windows. This location has opportunities for group work, although we do not recommend using this coffee place for that purpose. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Grab a coffee and relax! Exams can prove to be one of the hardest bossfights to overcome, but your trusty coffee will give you more strenght to endure it! </p>
