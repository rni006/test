                    Starbucks is a very popular place for studying. This Starbucks is small and very cozy. It has 2 areas where you can sit down. Inside and outside.  Since it is quite a small place, it is best to work with Individual assignments or read, since it is pretty quiet there. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you need to use your computer, it is best to  sit inside where there is a place for your computer to be charged. There are a lot of other people working on their assignments as well, which will only motivate you. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The outside area is best for reading books or writing notes. In this outside area, the tables are bigger. When it is raining, you can hear the drops hitting against the glass roof. The whole outside area is in glass, so you are able to watch other people go about their day.
