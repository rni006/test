                <h2>Starbucks</h2>

                <address>
                    <p>
                        Address: Vetrlidsallmenningen 2, 5014 Bergen
                    </p>
                </address>

                <p>
                    This is the first Starbucks that opened in Bergen. It is right above a popular restaurant and brings in many people. It is almost always crowded. This Starbucks is therefore best for group assignments. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are many big tables, where even a group of 8 or more people can sit down and talk. The awesome smell of coffee is an additional benefit.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Starbucks is the third place for people after home and office. You and your group can sit there in hours, even if all the coffee is over. 
                    The background noise will only make you and your group more confident to talk to each other.
