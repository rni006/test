                <p>
                    I'm a 19 year old student who studies Digital Culture at the University of Bergen. I already have knowledge about web design as I've studied IT previously.  The subjects I study this semester include Culture and Norms in the Information Society and Web Design. I enjoy drinking coffee while studying. Espresso and macchiato are some of my favourite types of coffee. When not studying, I play games on either PC or console. Some of my favourite games at the moment are Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, Tekken 7 and Fortnite. I have yet to play the new Spiderman and Red Dead Redemption games. I also love movies and music of all genres. Drinking coffee is something I like to do while doing all of these things. This project has allowed me to express my love for games, coffee and web design. It has been a pleasure to work on this project with great people who share the same interests as me.

                   H-hello! I am a 20 year old student with a passion for pixel art, games and coffee and in this project I was able to combine all these things, which is awesome! I did all the pixel art on this website except for the art on this page. Please don't look to closely at my art though, this was my first time doing pixel art so there are a lot of mistakes in them. I spend a lot of my time playing games, mostly Overwatch and Call of Duty 4. I love anime and it is really awesome to work with people that have the same interests as me.

                    I'm a 22 year old student at UiB who studies IT. This semester I have 3 subjects - Social Web, Network 
                    Security and Web design 1. I'm an active gamer, I play many different first person shooter games like Overwatch, Destiny and Counter Strike Global Offensive. Besides games
                    I also love anime and Japanese culture. That is something that all of us group members have in common. We got together as 
                    a group because of our hobby similarities. This website is a project we all enjoyed to make, and put pieces of our
                    hearts into.
